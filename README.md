I made two projects, this, and using Laravel. I know for certainly that you have a lot of better applications, but a can guarantee you that, if i have one skill, is that i can easily transport my knowledge beetween different languages, same as Java, PHP, Node JS.**
<br><br>
You can expect a hardworking and flexible employee that can work in the most diverse positions in development and infrastructure. Thank you for the opportunity, and i think you wont regret given me one more chance!
